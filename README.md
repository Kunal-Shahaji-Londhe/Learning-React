# React Learning Journey Repository👨‍💻

Welcome to my React Learning Journey repository!🙌 This space documents my progress in learning React and showcases the various projects I've built as I explore new concepts and functionalities.

## Learning Progress📖

I've been actively learning React and its ecosystem. Here's a summary of my progress:

- **Introduction to React**: Covered the basics of React, including components, state, and props.

- **React Router**: Explored navigation and routing in React applications using React Router.

- **State Management**: Learned about different state management techniques, including local state and global state with tools like Context API and Redux.

- **Hooks**: Explored React Hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, and more for functional component logic.


## Projects📘

### [Password-generator🔑](./project-1)

This project generates a unique password with whatever length user wants and with characters , numbers and alphabets.I Learned useEffect, useState, useRef Hooks with this project.

### [Currency-converter💸](./project-2)

This project converts currencies (ex. INR to USD). The goal of the project was to understand how to create custom hooks, and so i learned how to create a cutsom hook in react using this project.

### [React-router👍](./project-3)

This project was about how react routers work. goal was to learn how to create routes in react, and I implemented react-router-dom in this project.

### [Theme-Switcher🌥️](./project-4)

theme-switcher project's functionality was to change the theme from dark to light or vice versa through a toggle button. the goal of the project was context in react and how to create and use contexts.

## Future Learning Goals🔖

I plan to continue my React learning journey by exploring the following:

- **Advanced React Patterns**: Dive into advanced React patterns and best practices.

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Next.js**: Explore SSR concepts and build applications with Next.js.

- **Testing React Applications**: Learn testing strategies and tools for React applications.
